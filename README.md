# Vehicle Price Prediction Challenge

## Overview

This repository contains my submission for the Vehicle Price Prediction challenge. The goal of this challenge is to accurately predict the price of used vehicles based on various features provided in the dataset. Submissions are evaluated based on the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between the predicted and actual vehicle prices.

## Problem Statement

Given a dataset containing features of used vehicles, our task is to build a predictive model that estimates the price of a vehicle. The evaluation metric for this challenge is RMSE, defined as:

RMSE = sqrt((1/N) * sum((yi - yi_hat)^2))

where:
N is the number of instances in the test set
yi_hat is the predicted price for instance i
yi is the actual price for instance i

## Dataset

The dataset includes various features of used vehicles. The training set contains both the features and the target variable (price), while the test set contains only the features. The task is to predict the prices for the vehicles in the test set.

## Submission Format

The submission file should be a CSV file with the following format:

```
id,price
54273,39218.443
54274,39218.443
54275,39218.443
...
```

Each row should contain the ID of the vehicle and the corresponding predicted price.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the training and test datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- `src/`: Source code for data processing, feature engineering, and model building.
- `models/`: Saved models and any related artifacts.
- `submission/`: Final submission files.

## Approach

1. **Data Exploration**: Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution of features and target variable.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that may help improve model performance.
4. **Model Selection**: Experiment with different regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to find the best performing model.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the model's hyperparameters to enhance performance.
6. **Evaluation**: Assess the model using cross-validation and calculate RMSE on the validation set.
7. **Prediction**: Generate predictions for the test set and prepare the submission file.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the data preprocessing script to prepare the data.
4. Train the model using the training script.
5. Generate predictions and create the submission file.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results

The final RMSE on the test set will be reported here once the submission is evaluated.
